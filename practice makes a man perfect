Most programmers will tell you that one of the ways to improve your performance in competitive programming is to practice a lot of problems.

Our Chef took the above advice very seriously and decided to set a target for himself.

Chef decides to solve at least 10 problems every week for 4 weeks.
Given the number of problems he actually solved in each week over 4 weeks as P1,P2,P3, and P4, output the number of weeks in which Chef met his target.

Input Format
There is a single line of input, with 4 integers P1,P2,P3, and P4. These are the number of problems solved by Chef in each of the 4 weeks.

Output Format
Output a single integer in a single line - the number of weeks in which Chef solved at least 10 problems.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    int P1, P2, P3, P4;

    cin >> P1 >> P2 >> P3 >> P4;
    
    int count = 0;
    vector<int> a;
    a.push_back(P1);
    a.push_back(P2);
    a.push_back(P3);
    a.push_back(P4);

    for (int i = 0; i <= a.size(); i++)
    {
        if (a[i] >= 10)
        {
            count++;
        }
        else if (a[i] < 0)
        {
            break;
        }
    }
    cout << count;

    return 0;
}
